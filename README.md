# Survival rate of prostate cancer in a Sudameric Ocncologyc Instutute

Prostate cancer is the most common malignant tumor in men and 90% of cases occur in men over 65 years.

Prostate cancer is the most common malignant tumor in men, and the vast majority of cases occur after the age of 65 and are rarely diagnosed in men under the age of 45.

Survival rate is the percentage of people who survive after being diagnosed with a disease within a certain period of time (5 to 10 years). 

In general, prostate cancer survival rates are very good when the disease has been diagnosed in early stages, reaching 100%, 98% and 93% at 5, 10 and 15 years, respectively. This rate drops to 30% at 5 years if the diagnosis was at an advanced stage. Therefore, the survival rate would be directly related to the clinical stage of the disease.

The data for this small review were obtained from a South American oncological institution that specializes in cancer treatment. Therefore, patient data are confidential and have been anonymized.
